# text-to-speech
**Step 1**: Setting Up Your AWS Account
Sign Up for AWS:
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Sign up for a new account or sign in if you already have one.
Create an IAM User:
In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
Create a new user with programmatic access.
Attach the AmazonPollyFullAccess policy to the user.
Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

**Step 2:** Setting Up Your Development Environment
Install AWS CLI:
Follow the instructions on the AWS CLI installation guide.
Configure AWS CLI
Open your terminal and run aws configure.
Enter the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.
Install Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python):
Install Boto3 by running pip install boto3 in your terminal.

**Step 3: **Creating the Text-to-Speech Application
Set Up a New Project Directory:
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:
Install Flask (for a web interface) and Boto3:
pip install flask boto3
Create a Flask Application:
Create a file named app.py 
Create an HTML Template:
Create a folder named templates and within it, create a file named index.html 
Run Your Application:
Run your Flask application by executing python app.py in your terminal.
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the text-to-speech converter.

**Step 4:** Testing and Deployment
Test Your Application:
Enter some text in the input box on the web page and click "Convert to Speech".
Ensure the audio is generated and played back correctly.
Deploy to AWS (Optional):
If you want to make your application accessible online, you can deploy it using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda with API Gateway.
Follow the Elastic Beanstalk deployment guide or the AWS Lambda deployment guide.

**Step 5:** Enhancements and Customizations
Voice Customization:
Change the VoiceId parameter in the synthesize_speech method to use different voices available in Amazon Polly.
Output Format:
Modify the OutputFormat parameter to use different formats like ogg_vorbis or pcm.
User Interface:
Enhance the HTML template with CSS and JavaScript for a better user experience.
Error Handling:
Add error handling in your Flask application to manage exceptions and invalid inputs gracefully.
By following these steps, you'll have a functional text-to-speech converter using Amazon Polly.
